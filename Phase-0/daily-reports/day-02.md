# Day 02 - 2026-02-11

## 📌 Focus of the Day

- Learning basic terminal commands
- Learning npm fundamentals and basic usage

## 📚 What I Learned

### Terminal commands(terminal/commands.md):

- Terminal navigation: `pwd - ls - cd`
- Terminal creation: `mkdir - touch`
- Terminal Manipulation: `cp - mv - rm`
- Terminal Concept: `path: . - .. - ~`

- How can show the list of Installed package: `npm list`
- How to use Help command: `npm help`

## 🛠️ Practice

- I practice with a directory named `my-web` with some subdirectory and files inside it(for git & terminal commands).
- I practice with a directory named `npm-practice`(for npm commands).

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The terminal is a powerful tool to control the system faster than a GUI
- Understanding paths (absolute vs relative) is essential for working efficiently
- npm is a package manager, not a programming language
- npm helps manage project dependencies and keeps projects organized

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Understanding when to use relative paths vs absolute paths
- Getting used to working without a graphical interface

## ❓ Questions / Confusions

- Have I learned the basics of programming now?

## ✅ Tomorrow’s Plan

- Practice more terminal commands
- Practice more npm commands
- Using git and npm simultaneously
- Start Phase 1
