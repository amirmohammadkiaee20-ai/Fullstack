# Fullstack Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my full‑stack development learning path.

## Structure

- **Phase‑0/** – Preparation (Environment setup, Git, npm, terminal basics)

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to build a strong and practical foundation in full‑stack web development, progressing step by step from fundamentals to real‑world applications.

Throughout this journey, I aim to learn and master:

### Frontend

- HTML, CSS, and modern responsive design
- JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Modern frontend frameworks (such as React)
- Building clean, maintainable, and user‑friendly interfaces

### Backend

- JavaScript on the server using Node.js
- Backend frameworks (such as Express)
- RESTful APIs and backend architecture
- Authentication, authorization, and security basics

### Databases

- Working with databases (SQL & NoSQL concepts)
- Designing data models and relationships
- Connecting backend services to databases

### Development Practices & Tools

- Git and GitHub with real‑world workflows
- Writing clean commits and meaningful documentation
- Project structure and scalability principles
- Debugging, problem‑solving, and reading documentation
- Basic DevOps concepts (environment variables, deployment basics)

### End Goal

By the end of this learning path, I will be able to:

- Design and build complete full‑stack web applications from scratch
- Turn ideas into working products
- Read, understand, and contribute to other developers’ code
- Create portfolio‑ready projects suitable for real‑world use or job opportunities
- Continue learning independently with confidence and a solid technical foundation

This repository represents not just code, but a documented learning process focused on consistency, clarity, and long‑term growth as a professional developer.
