# Day 03 - 2026-02-12

## 📌 Focus of the Day

- Practice **Terminal**, **Git**, and **npm** commands
- Start **Phase 1: Learning Basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript**
- Begin learning **HTML**

## 📚 What I Learned

### Basic HTML Concepts

- Doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Page Structure: `<html> <head> <body>`
- Placement Order: `<head>` before `<body>` for example
- Headings: `h1/../h6`
- Paragraph: `p`
- Link: `a`
- Image: `img`
- Input field: `input`
- Multi-line text input: `textarea`
- Button: `button`
- Container element: `div`

## 🛠️ Practice

- **Terminal / Git / npm** commands
- Html practice file: Example1.html

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- I didn’t expect the HTML structure to be this **clean and elegant**.
- With a little repetition, I can recall HTML elements more easily, which helps transfer them into **long-term memory**.

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Prerequisite: A strong mind to prepare the structure

## ❓ Questions / Confusions

- Using a combination of commands feels a bit confusing.

## ✅ Tomorrow’s Plan

- Continue learning **HTML**
- Start an **introduction to CSS**
