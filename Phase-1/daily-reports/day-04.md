# Day 04 – 2026‑02‑13

## 📌 Focus of the Day

- Deepen understanding of HTML attributes
- Practice inline CSS (‍‍`color`, `background‑color`, `font‑size`, `margin`, `padding`, `width` & `height`)
- Strengthen familiarity with how HTML and CSS combine
- Continue Phase 1: Learning Basic HTML & CSS

## 📚 What I Learned

### HTML Attributes

- `src` → specifies the image source in `<img>`
- `href` → defines the link destination in `<a>`
- `title` → adds descriptive tooltips to elements

###  Inline CSS Properties

- `color` & `background‑color` → coloring text and background areas
- `text‑align` → aligning text to left, center, or right
- `font‑size` & `font‑family` → controlling text appearance and style
- `margin` & `padding` → spacing outside and inside elements respectively
- `width` & `height` → setting fixed element dimensions

Each property was tested with practical examples on multiple `<p>` and `<h2>` elements — observing how small changes create large visual differences.

## 🛠️ Practice

- Created an HTML file named `Example2.html` for hands‑on demonstrations
- Tested HTML attributes and inline CSS combinations
- Adjusted margins and paddings in various directions (top/right/bottom/left)
- Experimented with several color formats: keyword, hex (#f00), and RGB (rgb(255, 0, 0))

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Inline CSS gives immediate feedback.
- Margins & paddings are easier to grasp visually rather than theoretically.
- Seeing how attributes and styles cooperate helps you internalize web layout logic deeply.
- “HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the personality.”

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Remembering the order and shorthand syntax of margin/padding variations
- Managing visual balance while testing large margins and paddings
- Staying organized with many commented examples in one file

## ❓ Questions / Confusions

- For best readability, should margin and padding use consistent units (px vs %)?

## ✅ Tomorrow’s Plan

- Learn and practice Internal Style CSS using the ‍`<style>` tag inside `<head>`
- Understand and use CSS Classes for reusable styling across multiple elements
- Learn CSS IDs and understand the difference between class and id
- Practice selecting elements using class selectors (`.`) and id selectors (`#`)
- Use Firebug / Firefox DevTools to:

* Inspect HTML elements
* Test CSS changes live
* Debug layout and spacing issues (margin & padding)

- Create a clean and well‑structured practice file:

* Separate HTML structure from CSS logic (internal style)
* Use meaningful class and id names
* Apply styles to headings, paragraphs, images, and containers
